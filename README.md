# c++ task

Add binarySearchFirst functions for std::array and std::vector

- Implemented binarySearchFirst for std::array and std::vector to find the index of the first occurrence of a target element.
- Used existing binarySearch functions to simplify implementation.
- Updated main function to test binarySearchFirst on both std::array and std::vector.
- Outputs the index of the first occurrence or -1 if the target is not found.

Result

First occurrence in array: 1
First occurrence in vector: 1
